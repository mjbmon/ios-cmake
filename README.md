IOS CMake Projects
==================

This repository contains several projects for building
IOS apps with CMake. The general approach is to be able
to compile, build, and install the app completely from
the command line, without launching the XCode GUI. See
Workflow.md in each project for instructions.

* [Test1](test1/README.md) -- This is a simple app that displays a button and
             a label.

* [TestEdit](tedit/README.md) -- A simple text editor.
