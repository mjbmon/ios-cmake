A Very Simple IOS App.
======================

This project builds an IOS app that has a button and a label. The button
action hides/shows the label. The project is intended as a possible
template for ObjectiveC/C++ and C++ apps.

[Configure](CONFIGURE.md)

[Workflow](WORKFLOW.md)

TO DO:

  * Sometimes the simulator launches but nothing shows
    up on the screen. Clicking on the icon in the taskbar
    may launch it.
