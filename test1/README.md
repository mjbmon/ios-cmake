A Very Simple IOS App.
======================

This project builds an IOS app that has a button and a label. The button
action hides/shows the label. The project is intended as a possible
starting template for ObjectiveC/C++ and C++ apps.

[Configure](CONFIGURE.md)

[Workflow](WORKFLOW.md)

TO DO:

  * Document the configure process in more detail.

  * Document the app code

    * main, AppDelegate, ViewController
    * cns.h, cns.cc
    * ctest.h ctest.cc

  * Sometimes the simulator launches but nothing shows

    may launch it.
